This is very useful when you need specific cookies for accessing the websites or when a lot of your proxies are already blocked. Instead of trying randomly, a list of working sessions will be saved and a new Actor run can reuse those sessions. Note that the IP lock on sessions expires after 24 hours, unless the session is used again in that window.",
