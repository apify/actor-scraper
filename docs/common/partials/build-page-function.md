## [](#building-our-page-function) Building our Page function

Before we start, let's do a quick recap of the data we chose to scrape:

   1. **URL** - The URL that goes directly to the actor's detail page.
   2. **Unique identifier** - Such as **apify/web-scraper**.
   3. **Title** - The title visible in the actor's detail page.
   4. **Description** - The actor's description.
   5. **Last modification date** - When the actor was last modified.
   6. **Number of runs** - How many times the actor was run.
