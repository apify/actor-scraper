### [](#wrapping-it-up) Wrapping it up

And there we have it! All the data we needed in a single object. For the sake of completeness, let's add
the properties we parsed from the URL earlier and we're good to go.

{{#code}}wrapping-it-up-1.js{{/code}}

All we need to do now is add this to our `pageFunction`:

{{#code}}wrapping-it-up-2.js{{/code}}
{{> note-wrapping-it-up-2}}

### [](#test-run) Test run

As always, try hitting that **Save & Run** button {{dontForget}} and visit
the **Dataset** preview of clean items. You should see a nice table of all the attributes correctly scraped.
You nailed it!
