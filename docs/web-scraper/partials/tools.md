## [](#getting-to-know-our-tools) Getting to know our tools

In the [Getting started with Apify scrapers](https://apify.com/docs/scraping/tutorial/introduction) tutorial,
we've confirmed that the scraper works as expected, so now it's time to add more data to the results.

To do that, we'll be using the [jQuery library](https://jquery.com/), because it provides some nice tools
and a lot of people familiar with JavaScript already know how to use it.

> If you're not familiar with jQuery, you can find good information [in its docs](https://api.jquery.com/). And if you just don't want to use it, that's okay. Everything can be done using pure JavaScript, too.

To add jQuery, all we need to do is turn on **Inject jQuery** under the  **Input and options** tab.
This will add a `context.jQuery` function that you can use.

Now that's out of the way, let's open one of the actor detail pages in the Store, for example
the [Web Scraper](https://apify.com/apify/web-scraper) page and use our DevTools-Fu to scrape some data.
